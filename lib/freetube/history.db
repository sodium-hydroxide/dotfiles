There, it is attributed to Nathan Bowler&quot;\n\nI referenced quaternions at the end, and if you&apos;re curious to learn more, here are a few options.\n\nThis is a nice talk targetted at game developers:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en2QcehKJd8&t=0s\n\nThis video walks through concretely what the computation is for using quaternions to compute 3d rotations: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zsnHbQyRnc&t=0s\n\nMy own video on the topic is mainly focused on understanding what they do up in four dimensions, which is not strictly necessary for using them, but for math nerds like me may be satisfying:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg&t=0s\n\nAlso, one of the coolest projects I&apos;ve ever done was a collaboration with Ben Eater to make interactive videos based on that topic:\nhttps://eater.net/quaternions\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 - Intro\n0:32 - Twirling tiles\n6:45 - Tarski Plank Problem\n10:24 - Monge‚Äôs Theorem \n17:26 - 3D Volume, 4D answer\n18:51 - The hypercube stack\n25:52 - The sadness of higher dimensions\n\n\nSEV#3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXBtyYvMx24&t=0s\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom Python library, manim.

Thank you.\n\nThe Abbey receives no Church or State funding, and your support will help to protect our priceless heritage - from the unique building and collections to a world class music foundation - which has been put at risk by the drastic reduction in income caused by the Covid pandemic.\n\nThis specially recorded reading of St John&apos;s Gospel was filmed in the Jerusalem Chamber, Westminster Abbey, by acclaimed actor Sir David Suchet CBE.\n\nBest-known for playing Agatha Christie‚Äôs fictional detective Hercule Poirot, Sir David became a Christian in 1986 after reading a hotel room Bible. He has read the entire Bible before, for Hodder &amp; Stoughton‚Äôs NIV Audio Bible, which has sold over 100,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe Jerusalem Chamber in the Abbey‚Äôs Deanery, the residence of the Dean of Westminster, has a pivotal role in the history of printed versions of the Holy Bible. It hosted the committees engaged on writing King James I‚Äôs Authorized Version of the Bible in 1611, the Revised Version in 1870, the New English Bible in 1961 and the Revised English Bible in 1989.\n\nSt John‚Äôs Gospel reached its final form around AD 90‚Äì110, although it contains signs of origins dating back to AD 70 and possibly even earlier. Like the three other gospels, it is anonymous, although it identifies an unnamed ‚Äòdisciple whom Jesus loved‚Äô as the writer. \n\nThe New International Version of the Bible is the world‚Äôs most popular modern English Bible translation. Developed by Biblica, the International Bible Society, it remains at the forefront of accessibility, relevance and authority. More information about the translation and the range of Bibles available can be found at http://www.hodderbibles.co.uk/\n\nThe NIV Audio Bible is available in iOS and Android app formats, as well as on MP3 CD and as an audio download:\n\nhttp://linktr.ee/nivaudiobible\n\nThe Holy Bible, New International Version (Anglicised) ¬© 1973, 1979, 1984, 2011 Biblica, the International Bible Society.\nPublished by Hodder &amp; Stoughton Publishers, an Hachette UK company.

We&apos;ll contrast Nix with other ecosystems like Debian and Alpine and highlight some of the unique properties that make it a compelling alternative. Does your team struggle with development and production environments that are not in sync? For example, are local environments built using Brew, while production Docker images are built using Alpine? We explain how to build projects where the development, CI, and production environments are built from the exact same set of packages. We&apos;ll provide a set of sample Docker applications that illustrate these patterns (including applications written using Python, Golang, Node.js, Java, Ruby, Rust, and Clojure). We&apos;ll also provide public GitHub repos so that you can experiment using your own Docker Desktops.

It doesn‚Äôt answer why anything exists, but does describe what exists and how it behaves, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be discovering in this video. We will cover the fermions, which contain the quarks and the leptons, as well as the bosons or force carriers. As well as which of the fundamental forces each of these fundamental particles interact with, along with the Higgs field. We‚Äôll also look at the conservation rules of particle physics, symmetries in physics and the various quantum numbers that rule which particle interactions are valid and which are not.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/particlephysics\">#particlephysics</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standardmodel\">#standardmodel</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/domainofscience\">#DomainOfScience</a>\n\n<s>-- Posters ---</s>\nDFTBA Store: https://store.dftba.com/collections/domain-of-science?utm_medium=product_shelf&utm_source=youtube&utm_content=YT-ANKptbAIg24BtoNoYzQcemaGMK4SG0pCHAPQs8-5gEvT780YcSRMDrYztNm7BzLVNLTMdTY75-67F454NghbUb5G1ytZk9Tj8_uC-ZCuneR4UAdIh-2mRw7mLi1n2T5I3dk3EPZ2EDzCKsCH0rmMOmQwK0X344Tm6EhWo693bpE-G5V7e7cA1OlT \nRedBubble Store: https://www.redbubble.com/people/DominicWalliman\n\nI have also made posters available for educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/\n\n<s>- Some Awesome People --</s> \nAnd many thanks to my $10 supporters on Patreon, you are awesome!\nBob Milano\nAlex Polo\nEric Epstein\nKevin Delaney\nMark Pickenheim\nnoggieB\nRaj Duphare\nReggie Fourmyle\nSandy Toye\nSebastian\nTerrence Masson\n\nJoin the gang and help support me produce free and high quality science content:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/domainofscience\n\n<s>-- Special Thanks --</s>\nSpecial thanks to Sarah Johnson https://twitter.com/SJDJ and Henry Reich https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics for their fact checking help.\n\n<s>-- My Science Books ---</s>\nI also write science books for kids called Professor Astro Cat.

But is he as legit as he likes to try and make out...?\n\nCheck out my Patreon where I will be covering some extra Gary Vee gossip I found but couldn&apos;t fit in this video: https://www.patreon.com/munecat\n\nMerch store: https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/munecat-store\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/munecatmusic\nTwitter https://www.twitter.com/munecatmusic\n\nCopy to stroke the YT algo under its chinny chin chin like a little kitten:\n\nGary Vaynerchuk has always been one of those entrepreneur guru type figures on social media, constantly pumping out endless content on TikTok, Instagram, Youtube and Facebook to the younger generations with motivational content for young business wannabes needing inspiration. He&apos;s also used the fact that he was an early investor in Facebook and Twitter to market himself as some sort of genius of the digital age. He has also made a couple of accurate predictions, such as Joe Rogan moving to Spotify. But his predictions aren&apos;t always correct.\n\nBut he&apos;s managed to skirt the same reputation as the likes of Tai Lopez and his ilk of &apos;contrepreneurs&apos; by not directly and aggressively pushing an expensive course or event. He seems to be very concerned about separating himself from these people, and he makes his money in many other subtle ways, which I discuss in this video. This includes angel investing, in which he can get himself generous equity deals from startups just by simply being Gary Vee. \n\nHe also likely gets a huge chunk, if not most of his income through keynote speeches. He will get paid allegedly up to around $200,000 for a 1 hour keynote. However he doesn&apos;t seem to have much of a moral compass around who he makes keynote speeches for. For instance, he has accepted money to make keynote speeches at MLM events and at Success Resources events, at which he gets paid to be the bait to lure people to sit infront of 8 hours of speeches from get rich quick gurus, so his fans who have come to see him get suckered into paying grifters up to $10,000 to become a &apos;millionaire&apos;.\n\nGary also runs Vaynermedia, which is a marketing agency that targets millennials and Gen Z. Billionaires will invest in this company to ensure it stays afloat because they believe Gary Vaynerchuk is the marketing gateway to the youth because he has positioned himself as this on social media. Gary seems to be underpaying his young workers at Vaynermedia however, and there are plently of accusations of a poor workplace environment there, unpaid overtime and a toxic hustle culture. \n\nGary&apos;s message also includes advocating for toxic, over the top work ethic and constantly insinuates that hustling hard is the only thing that matters for getting rich. He also reckons being born poor or in an ethnic minority or being an immigrant or being African American is actually a privilege, because it makes you &apos;tougher&apos;, and that capitalism will rise you up if you&apos;re tough enough and just work hard enough.\n\nSources &amp; further reading: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NlcjdWNHyJXk9bRPe9M8oe9AoJPSRlZ0bX9D7cj2zJY/edit?usp=sharing ¬†\n\nAFFILIATE LINKS\n¬†\nCAMERA EQUIPMENT\nMy camera: https://amzn.to/3BtyOj6\nMy lens: https://amzn.to/3baf7Tg\nMy ringlight: https://amzn.to/3e9D5zZ\nMy teleprompter: https://amzn.to/3bWBTxb\nMy mic: https://amzn.to/3uR6wwQ\nMic mount: https://amzn.to/3e2dx81\nGreen screen: https://amzn.to/2NYssp1\n¬†\nVideos are edited with Adobe Premiere Pro, I also use Photoshop for thumbnails etc.\n¬†\nMUSIC EQUIPMENT\nAbleton Push 2: https://amzn.to/3qhEWoF\nKeyboard: https://amzn.to/3qgmsVE\nAudio Interface: https://amzn.to/3beqs4E\nAbleton Live Suite software: https://amzn.to/3bbfvks\nKomplete 13 Ultimate software: https://amzn.to/3bZahaB\nSoundproofing: https://amzn.to/3uQC5Xv and https://amzn.to/2NW6jHO\nSpeakers: https://amzn.to/3bVJ4Wo\nHeadphones: https://amzn.to/2PwMdo8\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Intro\n00:50 The origin story\n11:39 Where does his money come from?\n22:04 Protect your privacy!\n23:46 Vee for Vendetta (against social progress)\n33:15 Endorsing MLMs (The Beachbody Speech) &amp; dodgy companies\n36:46 Vaynermedia&apos;s awful employee reviews, opinions on social media\n43:32 Conclusion\n46:19 Song (Flashing Images!)","viewCount":1283301,"lengthSeconds":2955,"watchProgress":2954.507028,"timeWatched":1718509945831,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"61Td6Q64qXJJhFG9","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"9769a9ad-80e7-4ff1-844d-017a2f2097e4"}

Depending on your system, other kernel modules are needed for the system. In this case, it&apos;s highly recommended to still run: \n    nixos-generate-config --root /mnt\nBut this is useful if you want to reinstall the profile on the same formatted system.\nnix.settings.auto-optimise-store is currently only available on unstable\nI know it&apos;s curly.

Since current is constant, it is also an indication of differences in voltage, but the script should have been a little clearer.\n\nCurrent doesn‚Äôt flow to the ground; it flows through the ground and back up. If there is electricity moving into the ground from an energized conductor, go back to the source of that conductor and see what‚Äôs happening. For the grid, it‚Äôs probably a transformer or electrical generator, in either case, a simple coil of wire. And, the electrical current flowing out of the coil has to be equal to the electrical current flowing into it, whether that current is coming from one of the other phases, a neutral line, or an electrode buried in the ground.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-where-does-grounded-electricity-actually-go?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/?utm_medium=product_shelf&utm_source=youtube\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

The original Star Wars trilogy was groundbreaking for its special effects, its world building, its action, and so, so much more. But if you ask George Lucas, it isn&apos;t the action, nor the performances, or even the dialogue itself that ultimately carries the story of Star Wars. It is, fundamentally, John Williams&apos; iconic score that carries Star Wars, even without dialogue. By that notion, Lucas compares Star Wars to silent movies, which didn&apos;t depend on dialogue to move and entertain. Today we&apos;ll look at some of the ways one can experience the Star Wars films... a little differently.\n\nI make reference to two other video essays in this video.

Reynolds (Cereal Defense) It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia","author":"LegalEagle","authorId":"UCpa-Zb0ZcQjTCPP1Dx_1M8Q","published":1542392157000,"description":"‚öñÔ∏è Do you need a great lawyer?  I can help!  https://legaleagle.link/eagleteam ‚öñÔ∏è\nWhen Frank accidentally hits Dennis&apos;s car while Dennis is eating cereal, Frank and Dennis go to the Paddy&apos;s Pub court to face off on who will pay for the damages.  Court is in session at Paddy&apos;s Pub as Frank and Dennis present their cases to the rest of The Gang (with Dee and Charlie serving as lawyers and Mac as judge/bailiff), resulting in a verdict that will change their lives FOREVER... but not really.\n\nStay until the end for my Legal Realism Grade!   \n\nNew episodes weekly!

(50% off Premium Suits + free shipping) [https://legaleagle.link/indochino]: Off-the-rack suits NEVER fit right. Indochino makes fully custom suits that fit perfectly using any material I want, with all of the options I want. And they cost 1/3rd of what normal suits costs. I‚Äôve purchased them with my own money for years, so I‚Äôm thrilled they are now a sponsor.  \n\n‚ñ∂ Why Ties from TheTieBar? (Free shipping on orders over $50) [https://fave.co/2ImLY9I]: Normal ties are too fat. Skinny ties are too skinny. So these days I only wear ties that are exactly 2.5‚Äù wide. They are fashionable without being hipster. You see them in all of my videos. TieBar ties are perfect, come in every color I want, and never cost more than $19.\n\n‚ñ∂ Why these Tie Clips? [https://amzn.to/2WIQ6EE]: It‚Äôs really hard to find affordable tie clips that are the right size (1.5‚Äù), look good, and are great quality.  These tie bars are all three.  Plus the 3-pack gives a variety of styles. They pair perfectly with 2.5‚Äù ties from TheTieBar (above).  \n\n‚ñ∂ Why these Pocket Squares? [https://amzn.to/2UfsKtL]: I like my pocket squares perfectly, well, square. Like straight-out-of-Mad-Men square. The only way to do that is with a stiffer material that keeps its shape.  I‚Äôve exhaustively tried dozens of pocket squares, and these are by far the best. It‚Äôs how I get the perfectly flat pocket square you see in my videos.\n-------------------------------------------------- \n\nThis is part of a continuing series of &quot;Lawyer Reaction&quot; videos.

Without its community the project is a static lump of code. FreeBSD is one of the largest and longest continuously running open source projects around. Not only that, it comes from an even longer lineage before it via the original BSD work at the University of California, Berkeley. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it is without its problems.\r\n\r\nWhile FreeBSD isn‚Äôt in any danger of disappearing any time soon, it does have issues with attracting new contributors, keeping its existing contributors and keeping its community healthy. These issues are not always unique to FreeBSD but FreeBSD provides an interesting case study.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will cover:\r\n\r\n* How FreeBSD‚Äôs community and its processes have evolved over the years and how this compares to other, often newer, projects.\r\n* What FreeBSD could learn from other projects.\r\n* How this all fits into broader issues around open source development communities and things that do and don‚Äôt work.","viewCount":157448,"lengthSeconds":2753,"watchProgress":1889.559491,"timeWatched":1722058523508,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"AFSTRLDDkp5FFWtQ","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

{"videoId":"bXYRJJIn_wI","title":"How Michigan explains American politics","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":1704978034000,"description":"How Republicans won Michigan, how they lost it, and what it all tells us.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don&apos;t miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nThe ‚Äúblue wall‚Äù once referred to a group of Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast states that, conventional wisdom said, ‚Äúalways vote for Democrats.‚Äù Unfortunately for Democrats, that was wrong, and in 2016 Donald Trump shockingly won three ‚Äúblue wall‚Äù states ‚Äî including, narrowly, the state of Michigan.\n\nIt maybe shouldn‚Äôt have been such a shock, though. All three of the ‚Äúblue‚Äù states Trump won actually had a history of electing Republicans at the state level. Michigan in particular had been fully taken over since 2010 by Republicans, who then spent years gutting unions, restricting abortion, loosening environmental protections, and generally just turning a Republican policy wish list into law. So Trump winning Michigan was, in a way, just the culmination of a years-long drift to the right there.\n\nBut by 2022, something had changed dramatically. In a midterm election where Republicans were favored, Democrats won every branch of elected government in Michigan ‚Äî governor, state House, and state Senate. The state Senate in particular had not been under Democratic control since 1984. And Democrats got busy using their new power immediately: repealing much of the right-wing legislation of the previous years, passing strong LGBTQ protections, quadrupling a tax credit for the poor, and allocating a billion dollars for the auto industry to transition to electric cars. Suddenly Michigan was cranking out more progressive legislation than almost any other state in the US.\n\nSo to recap: Michigan was once a blue state, except it wasn‚Äôt actually, and in fact over time it got pretty red, but then it became an actual blue state. (Again?) Or something like that. Obviously, the truth is that Michigan is a swing state. But the story of each of those swings is actually key to understanding how US politics work in the 2010s and 2020s. And it can tell us a lot about our next election, too.\n\nChapters: \n0:00 The blue wall\n2:42 Maps\n4:52 The bellwether\n9:51 Exit polls\n13:08 2022\n15:43 Michigan and the US\n\nCorrection: the timeline incorrectly shows Republicans winning control of the state House in 2006. Democrats won the House that year.\n\nSources:\n\nFor Michigan election data we drew from two useful websites from the Michigan Department of State. First, they have election results down to the county level going back to the late 90s: https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/election-results-and-data\n\nThey also have a tool that produces election results down to the city/township level: https://miboecfr.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cfr/precinct_srch.cgi\n\nTo show national and statewide exit polls over time, we used NBC News‚Äôs data ‚Äî they‚Äôre among the only organizations whose granular exit poll results both nationally and statewide going back a decade are still publicly available.\n\nHere are links to their Michigan exit polls from 2012-2022:\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2012-election/michigan/president/index.html#exitPoll\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2014/mi/governor/exitpoll/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/mi/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2018-election/midterms/mi/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/michigan-president-results/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/michigan-governor-results\n\nAnd here are their national exit polls from 2012-2022: \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2012-election/all/president/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2014/us/house/exitpoll/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2018-election/midterms/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/exit-polls/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/exit-polls\n\nThe average per capita personal income of each Michigan county came from the US‚Äôs Bureau of Economic Analysis: https://shorturl.at/jtyM5\n\nThe question about whether the 2020 election should be overturned came from a May 2022 poll by Detroit‚Äôs chamber of commerce: https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/May-2022-Michigan-Voter-Survey-Report_Final.pdf\n\nThe data on Middle Eastern and North African Americans came from the 2020 US Census (which was the first one ever to ask about the US‚Äôs MENA population!): https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/2020-census-dhc-a-mena-population.html\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nSupport Vox&apos;s reporting with a one-time or recurring contribution: http://vox.com/contribute-now\n\nShop the Vox merch store: http://vox.com/store\n\nWatch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\n\nFollow Vox on Facebook: http://facebook.com/vox\n\nFollow Vox on Twitter: http://twitter.com/voxdotcom\n\nFollow Vox on TikTok: http://tiktok.com/@voxdotcom","viewCount":1574504,"lengthSeconds":1086,"watchProgress":616.066165,"timeWatched":1715186133204,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"CXDQ1v8KQqwQQ9n4","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"e4e97df5-9312-4bf5-9f20-d1f16c89ce30"}

This includes denying it exists, denying it is caused by humans, and denying government regulation will fix anything.\n\nWe will be tearing apart a terrible Ben Shapiro take, looking at the UK&apos;s Tory pundits and analysing the way Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have been approaching the issue by blocking streets in protest and generally holding street parties that look like Burning Man. \n\nI&apos;ll also be critising the way the media has been participating in false balance by platforming denial, and pushing the blame onto the consumer with &apos;carbon footprint&apos; propaganda, all of it funded by right-wing libertarian think-tanks, and the Koch Brothers among other oil barons, of course.\n\nAnd then, we shall be asking, well, how do we fix this? Is there a solution? Has neoliberalism doomed us all, or is there hope? Does Jeffrey Bezos have the answer?\n\nSources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W_VdKfHiIl0W94yrzYUj1Q_23RycfSFjaeL8ywGBG5E/edit?usp=sharing\n \nAFFILIATE LINKS\n \nCAMERA EQUIPMENT\nMy camera: https://amzn.to/3BtyOj6\nMy lens: https://amzn.to/3baf7Tg\nMy ringlight: https://amzn.to/3e9D5zZ\nMy teleprompter: https://amzn.to/3bWBTxb\nMy mic: https://amzn.to/3uR6wwQ\nMic mount: https://amzn.to/3e2dx81\nGreen screen: https://amzn.to/2NYssp1\n \nVideos are edited with Adobe Premiere Pro, I also use Photoshop for thumbnails etc.\n \nMUSIC EQUIPMENT\nAbleton Push 2: https://amzn.to/3qhEWoF\nKeyboard: https://amzn.to/3qgmsVE\nAudio Interface: https://amzn.to/3beqs4E\nAbleton Live Suite software: https://amzn.to/3bbfvks\nKomplete 13 Ultimate software: https://amzn.to/3bZahaB\nSoundproofing: https://amzn.to/3uQC5Xv and https://amzn.to/2NW6jHO\nSpeakers: https://amzn.to/3bVJ4Wo\nHeadphones: https://amzn.to/2PwMdo8\n\n<s>-timestamps-</s>\n0:00 Clussy\n1:16 The world is on fire, but it isn&apos;t very good for ratings\n19:09 Why are we arguing about peer reviewed science again?\n29:26 Why does Ben Shapiro exist again?\n33:55 Personal Responsibility, AKA Don&apos;t forget to scrub out your used tub of marmite, so when it gets stuck on the head of a turtle, at least it can still see\n42:09 Why COP26 was a failure and we&apos;re all going to die on a fiery ball in space\n48:57 The Military Industrial Complex\n54:38 A solution?\n1:00:09 B E Z O S W A V E","viewCount":1245677,"lengthSeconds":3992,"watchProgress":3885.695186,"timeWatched":1721967978536,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"DNO5EhL4blMquZeP","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"1e53098d-5a58-476e-8e68-55f7f35f22d7"}

It&apos;s just rare enough that societal elites can monopolize it, but common enough you can gather enough to actually make stuff with it.

Their structure including Schwarzschild radius or event horizon, the singularity, photon sphere, innermost stable orbit, accretion disk, Hawking radiation and the difference between rotating and non-rotating black holes. I also look at the evidence for their existence, the many ways we have detected them though x-ray astronomy, gravitational wave astronomy and radio astronomy. Then the many outstanding mysteries still to be solved including wormholes, the holographic theory and information paradox.

Sometimes plain, sometimes multi-colored, they‚Äôre absolutely everywhere.

That‚Äôs present in rainscreen cladding ‚Äî the enclosure system that ends up being used in so many of those distinctive panels. By creating a small air gap between the exterior wall and the structure, it gives water an opportunity to dry ‚Äî saving our modern buildings from any rot and decay.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more about how architects and building scientists use rainscreen cladding to explore aesthetic possibilities while protecting their buildings.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBuilding enclosures is an entire field with lots of intense debates, associations, and academic research.

It&apos;s risk-free with Nord&apos;s 30-day money-back guarantee! ‚úå\n\nSecond channel video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ne9yghOtw8&t=0s\n\nStein&apos;s paradox is of fundamental importance in modern statistics, introducing concepts of shrinkage to further reduce the mean squared error, especially in higher dimensional statistics that is particularly relevant nowadays, in the world of machine learning, for example. However, this is usually ignored, because it is mostly seen as a toy problem. Precisely because it is such a simple problem that illustrates the problem of maximum likelihood estimation! This paradox is the subject of many blogposts (linked below), but not really here on YouTube, except in some lecture recordings, so I have to bring this up to YouTube.\n\nThis is not to say that maximum likelihood estimator is not useful - in most situations, especially in lower dimensional statistics, it is still good, but to hold it to such a high place, as statisticians did before 1961? That is not a healthy attitude to this theory.\n\nOne thing I did not say, but perhaps a lot of people will want me to, is that this is an emprical Bayes estimator, but again, more links below.\n\nVideo chapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n04:38 Chapter 1: The &quot;best&quot; estimator\n09:48 Chapter 2: Why shrinkage works\n15:51 Chapter 3: Bias-variance tradeoff\n18:45 Chapter 4: Applications\n\nFurther reading:\nThe ‚Äúbaseball paper‚Äù: https://efron.ckirby.su.domains//other/Article1977.pdf\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein%27s_example\nDominating the (positive-part) James-Stein estimator: https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-22/issue-3/Improving-on-the-James-Stein-Positive-Part-Estimator/10.1214/aos/1176325640.full\nWikipedia (Empirical Bayes): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method\n\nOther writeups:\nhttp://www.ime.unicamp.br/~veronica/MI677/steinparadox.pdf\nhttps://joe-antognini.github.io/machine-learning/steins-paradox\nhttps://www.jchau.org/2021/01/29/demystifying-stein-s-paradox/\nhttps://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/steinviz/\nhttps://austinrochford.com/posts/2013-11-30-steins-paradox-and-empirical-bayes.html\nhttps://duphan.wordpress.com/2016/07/10/steins-paradox-or-the-power-of-shrinkage/\nhttp://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/SteinParadox.pdf\n\n(Philosophical implications) http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13303/1/Philosophical%20significance%20of%20Stein%20Preprint.pdf\n\nOther than commenting on the video, you are very welcome to fill in a Google form linked below, which helps me make better videos by catering for your math levels:\nhttps://forms.gle/QJ29hocF9uQAyZyH6\n\nIf you want to know more interesting Mathematics, stay tuned for the next video!\n\nSUBSCRIBE and see you in the next video!\n\nIf you are wondering how I made all these videos, even though it is stylistically similar to 3Blue1Brown, I don&apos;t use his animation engine Manim, but I will probably reveal how I did it in a potential subscriber milestone, so do subscribe!\n\nSocial media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mathemaniacyt\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_mathemaniac_/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mathemaniacyt\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathemaniac (support if you want to and can afford to!)\nMerch: https://mathemaniac.myspreadshop.co.uk/?utm_medium=product_shelf&utm_source=youtube\nKo-fi: https://ko-fi.com/mathemaniac [for one-time support]\n\nFor my contact email, check my About page on a PC.\n\nSee you next time!","viewCount":1053784,"lengthSeconds":1303,"watchProgress":1296.485817,"timeWatched":1717642059979,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"H7qDcAGw8GtptNTh","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"ac699a2c-54b8-4c64-b77b-1575475adeb9"}

We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!) . I recommend people watch the earlier makemore videos to get comfortable with the autoregressive language modeling framework and basics of tensors and PyTorch nn, which we take for granted in this video.\n\nLinks:\nGoogle colab for the video: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMLa53HDuA-i7ZBmqV7ZnA3c_fvtXnx-?usp=sharing\nGitHub repo for the video: https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture\nPlaylist of the whole Zero to Hero series so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=1&t=0s\nnanoGPT repo: https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT\nmy website: https://karpathy.ai/\nmy twitter: https://twitter.com/karpathy\nour Discord channel: https://discord.gg/3zy8kqD9Cp\n\nSupplementary links:\nAttention is All You Need paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\nOpenAI GPT-3 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 \nOpenAI ChatGPT blog post: https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\nThe GPU I&apos;m training the model on is from Lambda GPU Cloud, I think the best and easiest way to spin up an on-demand GPU instance in the cloud that you can ssh to: https://lambdalabs.com/ . If you prefer to work in notebooks, I think the easiest path today is Google Colab.\n\nSuggested exercises:\nEX1: The n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the `Head` and `MultiHeadAttention` into one class that processes all the heads in parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in nanoGPT).\nEX2: Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other data could be fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you&apos;re hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this, swole doge project: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of +-*/. Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces.)\nEX3: Find a dataset that is very large, so large that you can&apos;t see a gap between train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining?\nEX4: Read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem to use.

DeleteMe international Plans: https://international.joindeleteme.com/ üôå\n\nThe recent DMCA takedown notice from the ESA on popular rom sharing site VIMMS Lair is another blow to the preservation community. Nintendo believes ROM sites are haven for illegal activity, copyright infringement, and piracy and they have a history of taking down sites in the past including LoveROMs, Rom Universe and more. Can Nintendo be trusted to do it themselves? The Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) service is a fraction of the size of the Virtual Console and its unlikely it will ever exceed it. It&apos;s my view that Nintendo is effectively erasing their own history as more games are lost to time. In today&apos;s episode we take a closer look at why I believe the only true preservation in the video game industry are ROMS.\n\nNote: This episode is an opinion piece for entertainment purposes only.

However, I also cover some of the frustrations like the wonky formatting, lack of window snapping, confusing plugin installation process, and inefficient toolbar.\n\nWhile WebStorm has been a breath of fresh air in many ways, there are still aspects of VSCode that I miss. Join me as I navigate this coding journey and determine if WebStorm will truly become my new code editor home after 9 years with VSCode.

But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. \n\nWhat happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF‚Äôs Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures‚Äã‚Äã) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:\n\nWater can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-hot-superionic-ice-may-be-natures-most-common-form-of-water-20190508/\n\nHydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119442-metallic-hydrogen-finally-made-in-lab-at-mind-boggling-pressure/\n\nSodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312180838.htm\n\nPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,\na National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/\n\nWhat happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life.

This simple-sounding idea has some surprising moral implications: https://80000hours.org/kurzgesagt-last-human\n\nSources &amp; further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sources-last-human/\n\nThis video was created in partnership with the Open Philanthropy Project\n\nKurzgesagt in 8 languages: https://linktr.ee/kgs_international\n\nThe future of humanity seems insecure. Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight. But humans always thought they lived in the end times. Every generation assumes they‚Äôre important enough to witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. \nThis is a problem because it leads to short term thinking and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants. What makes this worse is that we actually may live at an extremely critical moment in human history. To understand why, let us look at the temporal window of humanity and ask:\nWhen will the last human be born and how many people will there ever be? \n\nOUR CHANNELS\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ‚ù§  https://kgs.link/shop-163?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=product_shelf  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army üêß  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3A5LwaB\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3OzdsIs\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\nüê¶üêßüê§ PATREON BIRD ARMY üê§üêßüê¶\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible: ziipzaaapM16A4, Filippo, Alloy robot, Harold Mabin Jr, Toby Lowe, BiohazardVictim, Riad Salihu, Gunnstein Lye, Jeff Wheeldon, Andy Kelly, Quenby Joanette, Daniel Schulte-Hillen, Val Kabalkin, Maximilian Thomas Goldstein, Tyler Lindberg, Felix, Davesanify, Russ Newman, Kira, Thomas Schenck, Skyler Stanley, dirk from wellington, LoveGiants (Polyamorous) Seeking 4 BrotherHusbands, BalrogWing, Coffee is the path to victory, Addie, Lucas, vb, Santiago Perez, Robert Walsh, Angus Jake Smith, JamesDBartlett3, Marlison Gosalvez de Alencar, Rahul Golwalkar, Keerthi Vasan, Brian Bradley, Lincoln Volk, Haubrechts, Avalanche, Craig B, Tina Hatch, Nathan Ornat, Amathara, khalifa almehairbi, jtfletchbot, Steven Zeck, Maurice Ibler, Bafy78, Andreas H√∏ve Smidt-Nielsen, Victoria Camp, Andrew Dawson, pierluigi valente, GH, Jay C, Sergey Melnik, CultistLemming, Thane Stevens, Alex MacKay, SimpleAvocado, Dave Kircher, Karen Rosenow, James Pita, Kyron","viewCount":13132044,"lengthSeconds":751,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1729837647843,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"Wx3c1PzHXzfOi8Z6","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"7c8c8af1-045d-4900-a30c-4e4d21f6f0a4"}

But then the covid pandemic hit, and amid increased isolation during lockdowns, fatal drug overdoses in the US skyrocketed, crossing 100,000 fatalities in a single year for the first time in 2021. \n\nThe main drivers of fatal overdoses over the last ten years are synthetic opioids, like fentanyl. Fentanyl is a highly potent narcotic that often gets mixed into the American drug supply to make drugs ‚Äì ranging from heroin, to cocaine, to adderall ‚Äì stronger and more addictive. The result is that huge numbers of people unknowingly consume a lethal dose of fentanyl laced into other drugs. \n\nAmerica‚Äôs ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù and punitive approach to curbing drug use hasn‚Äôt solved this. So now American communities are turning to methods that emphasize ‚Äúharm reduction‚Äù ‚Äì creating environments for people with substance use disorder to find support, rather than punishment. \n\nA big part of that is the distribution of the drug naloxone, also known as Narcan. Naloxone is an opioid-antagonist, and can temporarily reverse an opioid overdose as it‚Äôs happening. It does this by blocking opioid receptors in the brain.\n\nNaloxone has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives so far according to the CDC, and is a tool for fighting the ongoing overdose epidemic that some medical experts are now urging all Americans to have on hand. \n\nFind harm reduction resources near you (US only):\nNational Harm Reduction Coalition‚Äôs Naloxone Finder: https://harmreduction.org/resource-center/harm-reduction-near-you/\n\nFree harm reduction supplies by mail from non-profit NEXT Distro: https://nextdistro.org/naloxone#state-finder\n\nSources and further reading:\nThe American Medical Association‚Äôs Overdose Epidemic Report for 2023: https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/ama-overdose-epidemic-report.pdf\n\nLatest drug overdose death rate data from National Institutes of Health: https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates\n\nCDC guidance on overdose prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/index.html\n\nStruggling with substance use disorder?

More of his hip hop analysis can be found here: http://www.rapanalysis.com/\n\nA crisp and clear vocal performance is a vital component of all genres of popular music. So when Kanye West recorded his debut single, &quot;Through the Wire,&quot; with his jaw completely wired shut after a car accident, he was taking a huge risk.\n\nWhen you listen to &quot;Through the Wire,&quot; you immediately hear that Kanye &quot;chipmunk soul&quot; in his pitched-up sample of Chaka Khan&apos;s &quot;Through the Fire.&quot; But you also hear Kanye riff: Yo, Gee, they can‚Äôt stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?\n\nHis voice is muffled and lispy. It&apos;s not clear at all. But that vocal performance illustrates something unique about his work as a producer and artist: His greatest instrument has always been the human voice.\n\nHere&apos;s a Spotify playlist for some select Kanye West tracks. \nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/estellecaswell/playlist/4We6iitXGS13jnzujboBHe\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what&apos;s really driving the events in the headlines.

But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring &quot;the Martian&quot; home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney&apos;s safe return.\n\nIf you like my stuff, please subscribe and support !\nlink : https://tinyurl.com/3xfwtbsv\n\nDirected by : Ridley Scott\n\nStarring : \nMatt Damon\nJessica Chastain\nKristen Wiig\nJeff Daniels\nMichael Pe√±a\nKate Mara\nSean Bean\nSebastian Stan\nAksel Hennie\nChiwetel Ejiofor\n\nProduced by : \nSimon Kinberg\nRidley Scott\nMichael Schaefer\nMark Huffam\n\nWritten by :Drew Goddard\nBased on :The Martian by Andy Weir\n\nMusic by :Harry Gregson-Williams\n\nCinematography : Dariusz Wolski\n\nEdited by :Pietro Scalia\n\nProduction\ncompanies : \nScott Free Productions\nKinberg Genre\nTSG Entertainment\n\nDistributed by :20th Century Fox\n\nRelease date  September 11, 2015 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n20th Century Fox (2015)\nFair use. \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

The cars will have less combustion power, and more power will come from the electric motor. This shift will create energy challenges, so the cars will have less aerodynamic drag and less downforce - that does save energy, but it also means slower cornering speeds. But, not to fear, the new cars have more horsepower, not less, so they&apos;ll definitely be quicker, right? Well, we&apos;ll have to do a little math to find out.

I loved it!  You all are the best.  Here are just two of my favorites.\nBy a channel STEM cell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils7GZqp_iE&t=0s\nBy Doga Kurkcuoglu: http://bilimneguzellan.net/bouncing-cubes-and-%CF%80-3blue1brown/\n\nAnd here&apos;s a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html\n\nNY Times blog post about this problem:\nhttps://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/\n\nThe original paper by Gregory Galperin:\nhttps://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf\n\nFor anyone curious about if the tan(x) ‚âà x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin&apos;s paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9&apos;s.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.\n\nAlthough I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then &quot;add subtitles/cc&quot;.  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nTimestamps\n0:00 - Recap on the puzzle\n1:10 - Using conservation laws\n6:55 - Counting hops in our diagram\n11:55 - Small angle approximations\n13:04 - Summary\n\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nGerman: Greenst0ne\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

{"videoId":"_ZSFRWJCUY4","title":"2022 -  Non-Euclidean Doom: what happens to a game when pi is not 3.14159‚Ä¶","author":"MCH2022","authorId":"UCHmPMdU0O9P_W6I1hNyvBIQ","published":1658680407000,"description":"https://media.ccc.de/v/mch2022-236-non-euclidean-doom-what-happens-to-a-game-when-pi-is-not-3-14159-\n\n\n\nWe all know that the value of pi is a constant with a particular immutable value. Anyone who has done any graphical programming also knows that visual rendering relies not just on pi but trigonometry more broadly as well as other mathematical techniques. If we look into the source code of the first person shooter Doom we find that the value of pi used in the game is wrong. In this talk I will explore what happens when we subtly and not so subtly break math in the source.\n\nDoom is a well known classic first person shooter game with source code released under the GPL in 1999. In this talk I will begin by exploring what happens to the game when we make the value of pi even more wrong. What about when we change other trigonometric functions and constants to incorrect values? How will our familiar understanding and ability to traverse this virtual world change when we do this. Are there any interesting gaming possibilities with non-Euclidean geometries? A brief segway will cover some optimization tricks made to enable the game to run well on hardware available at the time. At the end I will provide a link to other games and public source code repositories that also use an incorrect value of pi. Pointers will also be provided to allow the audience to compile their own incorrect math version of the game.\n\nLuke Gotszling\n\nhttps://program.mch2022.org/mch2022/talk/ZM99EG/\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/mch2022\">#mch2022</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/mch2022curatedcontent\">#MCH2022Curatedcontent</a>","viewCount":225248,"lengthSeconds":1153,"watchProgress":789.425396,"timeWatched":1716081958729,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"cITbQcvN7RuJ6yzw","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"aea953a1-63df-4535-b31f-0d2ddf6ccf8a"}

Here&apos;s a fully-worked example of how.\n\nVeritasium posted a followup video to the one mentioned here, which I&apos;d highly recommend. It looks more into the dynamics whereas this video focuses on the statics. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI_X2cMHNe0&t=0s\n\nMathematica notebook for calculating the Poynting vector in a circuit: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yf_RgQlE5KzqOlFYB8yMXUFiP6O_dZfg/view?usp=sharing\nPDF version:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14yTFRSe7wwACzLPqXQdEHhAu0W2N-zoe/view?usp=sharing\nVeritasium&apos;s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY&t=0s\nElectroBOOM&apos;s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iph500cPK28&t=0s\nAnimations were made with Manim: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html\n\nI tried to keep this video reasonably short but I know lots of people are going to have lots of questions, so here&apos;s a long FAQ to cover some things that I missed in the video:\n\nQ: In the wire between the capacitor plates, why does the energy come from far away?\nA: This is a quirk of using infinitely big plates, as we just assume the plates have a voltage difference without making it clear where the source is. We could picture the plates as very big disks, and at their edges are a ring of batteries connecting them providing the voltage difference.\n\nQ: Doesn&apos;t that formula for the magnetic field only work for an infinitely long wire?\nA: Yes, I had to sacrifice exactness for simplicity. The calculations for the square-shaped circuit make no such approximation, although they do assume infinitely thin wires, and this assumption needs to be treated as an approximation when calculating the total power. Give me a break, I&apos;m trying my hardest!\n\nQ: If electric and magnetic fields are produced by charges and currents, then surely it is correct to say that energy is carried in the wires?\nA: This is really a question of semantics and there are many arguments to be made either way. Fields can exist without charges and currents in the form of electromagnetic radiation, although you could argue that the radiation had to come from particles originally. Special relativity and quantum mechanics makes these philosophical questions very difficult.\n\nQ: I heard that charges move through a circuit very slowly. If that&apos;s true, then how do charges build up on the surfaces of wires?\nA: Individual charges don&apos;t have to move very far because there are many more positive and negative charges filling the wires. The battery pushes in charges at one end and everything shifts over very slightly, resulting in more charges coming out at the other end and on the surface. Think of it like squeezing water into a teabag; the water doesn&apos;t flow through very quickly, but a decent amount still oozes out the sides. Man, that&apos;s a disgusting analogy.\n\nQ: Why do the wires in the two examples in the video behave in such different ways?\nA: In the parallel plates example, the wire is resisting and taking up the entire voltage drop across the circuit. That means energy is flowing into the wire and being turned into heat. For the battery and lightbulb, the wires are ideal and so no energy flows into them. Real wires with low resistance are somewhere between these, with the Poynting vector directed mostly parallel to the wires but also slightly into them.\n\nQ: So... ideal wires are kind of weird?\nA: Yes. If there is a voltage source across an ideal wire, the current is theoretically infinite, which doesn&apos;t make sense. The calculations only make sense if at some point in the circuit there is something to take up the drop in voltage between the terminals of the battery, e.g. a light bulb. But this isn&apos;t hard to see for yourself: if you attach a conducting wire to both ends of a battery, you&apos;ll find that it heats up very quickly. A lot of current is flowing through because of the low resistance. Be careful if you try this at home, because it&apos;s a very fast way to burn yourself.\n\nQ: Circuits use measured quantities like resistance, but electrodynamics also has measured quantities like resistivity and permittivity. Where do these quantities come from?\nA: The electric properties of a material are determined by the material&apos;s atomic structure, and studying this requires a looooot of quantum mechanics. This area of physics is called &apos;solid state&apos; or &apos;condensed matter&apos; physics, and it provides quantum-mechanical explanations for things like electrical properties, colour, transparency, elasticity and brittleness.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:20 A wire between plates\n05:58 A simple circuit\n09:41 Electrodynamics versus circuits\n13:23 Conclusion","viewCount":84304,"lengthSeconds":863,"watchProgress":863.255,"timeWatched":1732129881696,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"dpsoan2W0iNEFQ2P","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

The first 200 people get 20% off an annual premium subscription.\n\nIn previous videos, we looked at how to find the ideal road for any given wheel shape and vice-versa, but what about getting two wheels to roll smoothly around each other? Would two such wheels work as gears?\n\nEpisode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGxSTzaID3k&t=0s\nEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0aOxj5lrKY&t=0s\n\n=Chapters=\n0:00 - Intro\n1:23 - Defining smooth rolling\n2:30 - Sidenote about gears\n3:16 - The Wheel-Coupling Equations\n7:34 - Sanity check\n9:24 - The partner for an ellipse\n12:24 - The connection between ellipses and parabolas\n13:23 - Finding self-coupling wheels\n16:35 - The partner for a square\n19:21 - A look back\n20:20 - A fractal wheel??\n20:47 - Brilliant ad\n\n\n===============================\nI would also like to thank the user @BeekersSqueakers whose comment I think it was that taught me that a partner wheel can be generated by first generating a road and then generating a wheel on its underside. This comment was directly responsible for inspiring the technique shown in this video to easily generate self-coupling wheels, and dramatically simplified the second half of this video! So a seriously genuine thank you to @BeekersSqueakers and to all those who actually took up the call to answer my challenge problems in a comment! They can have a surprisingly big impact sometimes!\n\n\n===============================\nFor a deeper dive into the concepts explored in these videos, take a look at the paper &quot;Roads and Wheels,&quot; an article by Leon Hall and Stan Wagon that appeared in Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 65, No. 5 (Dec 1992).

Please identify all the traffic lights first.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications (üîî ) so you don&apos;t miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIt&apos;s not you ‚Äî captchas really are getting harder. The worst part is that you‚Äôre partly to blame.\n\nCorrection: At 5:22, we say that Google uses reCaptcha V2 data to train their self-driving cars and improve Google maps. While they have used V2 tests to help improve Google maps, according to an email from a Waymo representative (Google‚Äôs self-driving car project), they aren‚Äôt using this image data to train their autonomous cars. For more on the future of self-driving cars, check out this article from Vox‚Äôs Kelsey Piper: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/14/21063487/self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-waymo-cruise-uber \n\nA captcha is a simple test that intends to distinguish between humans and computers. While the test itself is simple, there&apos;s a lot happening behind the scenes. The answers we give captchas end up being used to make AI smarter, thus ratcheting up the difficulty of future captcha tests.\n\nBut captchas can be broken by hackers. The tests we‚Äôre most familiar with already have been broken. Captcha makers try to stay ahead of the curve but have to balance increasing the difficulty of the test with making sure any person on earth ‚Äî regardless of age, education, language, etc. ‚Äî can still pass it. And eventually, they might have to phase out the test almost entirely.\n\nRead more about captchas from the Verge:\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-inte\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what&apos;s really driving the events in the headlines.

This event, while not unique in the least, is a striking example of how corporate negligence causes environmental an humanitarian disasters. In the weeks since the crash, several other trains have derailed, including at least one more of Norfolk Southern&apos;s. Why is this such a common problem? What has led to the US having over 1,000 derailments per year, and why isn&apos;t anything being done about it?

{"videoId":"RPCKzgITCRI","title":"How The Holocaust Happened","author":"Then & Now","authorId":"UCkS_HP3m9NXOgswVAKbMeJQ","published":1611756425000,"description":"What drives ordinary everyday people to become mass killers? What are the psychological mechanisms and cultural factors that lead to genocide? What were the causes of the Holocaust? Can we theorize a psychology of genocide? A theory of genocide?\n\nThe Holocaust was not perpetrated solely by a few sadistic psychopaths but by tens of thousands of everyday Germans, Poles, Frenchmen, Austrians, Slovakians, in fact, much of Europe took part.\n \nIf any of us could be motivated under the right conditions to become mass serial killers, how can we protect ourselves against the threat? How might we innoculate our societies and cutlures from decending into genocide?\n\nThere are a number of factors that lead to the Holocaust. Compartmentalization, euphemism, conformity, authority, rationalization, propaganda, anti-Semitism, victimhood, and association, in particular. \n\nGustav Le Bon, for example, argued that individuals are more likely to conform in a crowd because of anonymity and mimesis. Stanley Milgram‚Äôs famous experiments looked at conformity to authority. This combined with rationalisations like ‚Äòits either us or them‚Äô or ‚Äòthey won‚Äôt survive through the winter anyway.‚Äô\n\nThere was still a system of belief ‚Äì an ideology ‚Äì and almost a decade of propaganda disseminated by the Nazi Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (RMVP). Years of anti-Semitism in Germany and Europe led to conspiracy theories about Jewish world domination. While Britain, the USSR, and America were all consistently associated with ‚ÄòJewish aggressors‚Äô.\n\nWhen a person perceives themselves as a victim and a prisoner as an aggressor in a war of survival and we combine this with the pressure to conform and submit to authority the probability for murder increases.  In Nazi Germany, everything was made to fit this formula.\n\nErvin Staub proposes a model of genocide that has three initial stages:\n\nFirst, there‚Äôs the frustration of basic needs.\nSecond, An out-group is identified that‚Äôs the cause.\nNext, The in-group is motivated by a ‚Äòutopian vision‚Äô that excludes a certain group.\n\nAnd Herbert Kelman has also argued that the requirements are threefold: authorization, routinization, and dehumanization.\n\nHow does all of this fit together?\n\nThen &amp; Now is FAN-FUNDED!

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his stoically ever-professional captain, Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), along with their diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD&apos;s 99th Precinct. In this final season of the series, Jake and the squad must try to balance their personal lives and their professional lives over the course of a very difficult year.\n\nRounding out the ensemble is Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumera), who has a passion for organization and a weakness for dork dancing; Lt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), a mountain of a man whose most powerful muscle is his sweetheart; Jake&apos;s best friend and human puppy dog, Det. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio); and the incredibly secretive, tough-as-nails Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Also part of the Nine-Nine are veteran officers Det. Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Det. Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker), whose only skill as police officers is their ability to make a passable pot of coffee.\n\nCreated by Emmy Award-winning writer/producers Dan Goor and Michael Schur, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; won the 2014 Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical (Samberg). Emmy winner Braugher earned four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Capt.

In 2018, RStudio introduced its package reticulate and clearly demonstrates that it favours to join forces. Both languages have strengths and weaknesses. Tools to combine the strengths will enable easier collaboration in projects and more possibilities to succeed. Using Python from R gives R users wider access to functions and makes it easier for Python beginners to just run scripts and being able to collaborate in Python projects. The talk will show the possibilities of reticulate: The main part starts with demonstrating the Python interpreter within R. It will show how to source Python scripts as well as install and import modules. Then it will deal with the most important types of Python objects, how they are represented in R and how to further manipulate them. Thereby, a special focus is on using Python for data science. In addition, it will be presented how Conda environments can be created and used from R. A further application will be the creation of reports with Markdown and LaTeX where R and Python can be used within one document and share objects. A last topic is about showing the possibilities for easier development in RStudio (help regarding Python functions, auto completion).","viewCount":2494,"lengthSeconds":2577,"watchProgress":75.258418,"timeWatched":1730253443171,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"kQyiUVxA9oaE668K","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

I extracted the audio in each segment and used Fourier analysis. I found the average spectrum for each cat (N = 6) using zero-padding and a hamming window. From these 6 average spectrum, I found the average shift for 5 of the cats was 3 Hz, and the last cat had no shift at all. \n\nA hand wavey explanation for the time delay coordinates: If you want to go deeper into this method, its also often called &apos;Takens Embedding Theorem&apos;. The reason this method works roughly speaking is because the past of one variable influences the present state of another variable. By plotting one variable against the past of itself, it is bringing out the influence of these other variables. However, this puts some conditions as well. First, the variable of interest needs to be a function of all the other variables. In the Lorenz system this means we cannot use what is traditionally labeled the z-coordinate (e.g., as seen on the wikipedia page for &apos;Lorenz system&apos;). The z variable is only a function of x (and z itself). This means the shadow manifold would not accurately recover the Lorenz system because the past of z does not contain information about the y-coordinate. I actually would like to perhaps make a video on this because there was originally a 5ish minute long section in the video just on this topic, but I cut it for time. If you&apos;ve read this and are interested let me know. If I have time I&apos;ll make it and put it on the secondary channel. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@notdavidsecondary9958\n\nA small mistake(ish): The way I define the stretch factor is a bit loose. At 13:01 the new size is equal to the stretch factor times the initial size. This is fine, but then I say the stretch factor is normally called the lyapunov exponent and treat them interchangeably. But actually the way I&apos;ve written it, it should be that stretch factor = exp(lyapunov exponent). Nothing conceptually really changes but this is why in my demo of the sphere deforming the stretch factor becomes negative -- its because I&apos;m treating it equivalently to the lyapunov exponent which can be negative. \n\nHeart analysis: While people do indeed use chaos analysis on heart beat recordings, heart rate variability derived from EKG recordings is more commonly studied, where as I am just using the EKG signal directly. A healthy heart should have small variability, but if it is too small then your heart cannot respond to changing demand. Thus it could be that heart beats are actually optimally slightly chaotic or operate at an edge of chaos transition. There was a good paper on this that I can&apos;t find at the time of writing. I&apos;ll update it if I find it, but in the mean time, here is a somewhat recent example paper (&quot;Chaos-Based Analysis of Heart Rate Variability Time Series in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Subjects&quot;, 2020) and &quot;Chaos Theory, Heart Rate Variability, and Arrhythmic Mortality&quot; is a nice little review, but it is from 2000. It is still well written.","viewCount":75799,"lengthSeconds":1109,"watchProgress":18.780427,"timeWatched":1714245152193,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"kqqEJPRCJUlmJ7XV","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nThe ‚Äúdirty side‚Äù of a hurricane refers to the part of the storm that usually brings the highest impacts: the greatest winds, greatest tornado risk, and greatest storm surge and flooding. In the case of Atlantic hurricanes, which rotate counterclockwise, the ‚Äúdirty side‚Äù is on the right ‚Äî where the winds are moving in the same direction as the storm, combining their speeds. This is why the greatest risk of storm surge during a hurricane is at the center of the storm, in the ‚Äúeyewall,‚Äù and to the right of it, where the forward-moving winds push water onto shore.  \n\nBecause the center of the storm is the strongest, forecasters tend to focus on tracking it, using a popular tool called the ‚Äúforecast cone,‚Äù which shows the potential path of the center of a storm, but leaves out the wider impact areas. So many viewers of hurricane forecasts don‚Äôt realize a storm‚Äôs impacts reach far beyond the cone, and in particular on the right-hand side of the storm. \n\nSources and further reading:\n\nNOAA explanation of the ‚Äúdirty side‚Äù of a tropical cyclone: \nhttps://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd-faq/#tc-rightside-winds\n\nWhy Hurricane Helene is a wake-up call, by Lavanya Ramanathan and Umair Irfan for Vox: \nhttps://www.vox.com/natural-disaster/374366/hurricane-helene-florida-big-bend-beryl-storms-climate\n\nWhy the &apos;dirty side&apos; of a hurricane can be 50% stronger than its &apos;clean side,&apos; by Lucy Sherriff for BBC:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240916-what-is-the-dirty-side-of-a-hurricane\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what&apos;s really driving the events in the headlines.

The Pentagon,&quot; CNN insisted in 2020. &quot;Democrats Need To Learn How To Get Excited About the Center-Left,&quot; The Messenger proclaimed in 2023. \n\nThese posts were all facilitated, sponsored, or authored by a member of a Democratic-aligned, corporate U.S. think tank. Whether the Center for American Progress, Center for a New American Security, Center for Strategic and International Studies, or any other Washington, DC-based &quot;Center&quot; with a capital C, center-right to center-left think tanks are ubiquitous in major American media and in Democratic policymaking.\n\nThis might seem unremarkable, even beneficial. Think tanks, after all, purport to be empirical institutions, designed to craft research-based policy proposals. But, given the prevalence of corporate funding in the DC think-tank world, these claims of neutrality contradict the anti-labor and anti-regulation records of major US think tanks, as well as their function as de facto corporate lobbying groups.\n\nOn this episode, Part II of our two-part series on the relationship between political party officials, media, and the corporate laundering machine, we examine the revolving door between Democratic administrations and corporate and despot-funded think tanks, looking at how those institutions effectively serve as a stomping grounds of business industry influence on everything from climate to labor, healthcare to infrastructure.\n\nOur guest is The Intercept&apos;s Akela Lacy.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFollow the show on:\nTwitter: @CitationsPod\nFacebook: Citations Needed\nMedium: https://citationsneeded.medium.com/\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded\n\nBuy some merchandise:\nhttps://www.bonfire.com/store/citations-needed/ \n\nBecome a supporter of the show: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/CitationsNeededPodcast\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 Intro\n31:22 Interview\n1:03:06 Close","viewCount":293,"lengthSeconds":4175,"watchProgress":13.860901,"timeWatched":1726779963735,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"nwbGfkHVJ5RktvJ9","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Even if you don&apos;t like pokemon I hope you stick around - the point here is not to look at pokemon, but rather showcasing an example of applying rigerous real world mathematics to something a bit silly, with the hopes of reaching students who think math is boring.\n\nI am trying to aim for quality over quantity with these videos.

Please note: a contributor has made an amazing expansion to the code that looks at the dual type network and which is included, and ... yeah... it&apos;s significantly more complex. For the sake of keeping the code organized/safe I will not be accepting new merges/commits but you are of course welcome to download it and edit your own local version and let me know in the comments if you discover something interesting https://github.com/notDavidsGit/pokemonNetworkAnalysisCode.git\n2. 1:13 Kpop fan club network: https://www.abacademies.org/articles/an-analysis-of-the-korean-popular-culture-on-social-media-examination-of-the-thai-fandom-through-twitter-in-thailand-11538.html\nStarwars social network: http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/\n3. 2:53 We could also treat any undirected network as a directed network where theres a link going both ways, but this is often conceptually combersome\n4. 3:06 Self loops are often debated about whether or not they should be kept. For example, in a friendship network where nodes represent people, and links represent friendship between those people, should you be linked to yourself? Philosophically I guess yes, but does that actually add anything to the analysis in the end?\n5. 3:15 I really do mean it when I say we are leaving out a lot. I didn‚Äôt even go into type resistances and immunities as I felt that would over-complicate the analysis and figures, without actually adding much to the actual ‚Äúmeat‚Äù of the theory. For those curious, the type advantage network is probably best described as a WEIGHTED directed network, whereas we considered only a BINARY directed network here. \n6. 5:15 These angle brackets are the physics notation for the average of a quantity. \n7. 5:28 Theres another property that I didn‚Äôt talk about here thats worth thinking about if your keen - the average directed degrees are equal to half the average un-directed degree.\n 8. 6:09 I should emphasize here that the criterion for connectedness is that ANY node can reach ANY other node. So while you can reach the normal type following directed paths, you cannot reach any other node from the normal type.\n9. 6:28 In a lot of cases even if we know a network should be directed, we cant measure it for technological reasons. For example, in the brain, inferring which neurons are ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù from which other neurons is extremely difficult to measure for anything more than a handful of cells.\n10. 7:19 This is primarily a list of functions from the networkX python library if you are interested in playing with them.\n11. 8:55 The technical term for this is network reciprocity. Because no element is advantageous against an element it connects back to, the reciprocity is zero.

in?\r\nLemme tell ya\r\nYeah, it&apos;s a wonder man can eat at all\r\nWhen things are big that should be small\r\nWho can tell what magic spells we&apos;ll be doing for us\r\nAnd I&apos;m giving all my love to this world\r\nOnly to be told\r\nI can&apos;t see, I can&apos;t breathe\r\nNo more will we be\r\nAnd nothing&apos;s gonna change the way we live\r\n&apos;Cause we can always take, but never give\r\nAnd now that things are changing for the worse, see\r\nWhoa, it&apos;s a crazy world we&apos;re living in\r\nAnd I just can&apos;t see that half of us immersed in sin\r\nIs all we have to give these\r\nFutures made of virtual insanity, now\r\nAlways seem to be governed by this love we have\r\nFor these useless, twisting, of our new technology\r\nOh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground\r\nAnd I&apos;m thinking what a mess we&apos;re in\r\nHard to know where to begin\r\nIf I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made\r\nAnd now every mother can choose the color\r\nOf her child, that&apos;s not nature&apos;s way\r\nWell, that&apos;s what they said yesterday\r\nThere&apos;s nothing left to do, but pray\r\nI think it&apos;s time to find a new religion\r\nWhoa, it&apos;s so insane\r\nTo synthesize another strain\r\nThere&apos;s something in these futures\r\nThat we have to be told\r\nFutures made of virtual insanity, now\r\nAlways seem to be governed by this love we have\r\nFor these useless, twisting, of our new technology\r\nOh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, wow\r\nNow there is no sound\r\nIf we all live underground\r\nAnd now it&apos;s virtual insanity\r\nForget your virtual reality\r\nOh, there&apos;s nothing so bad\r\nAs a man-made man\r\nOh, yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)\r\nI know I can&apos;t go on\r\nOf this virtual insanity we&apos;re living in\r\nHas got to change, yeah\r\nThings will never be the same\r\nAnd I can&apos;t go on\r\nWhere we&apos;re living in\r\nOh, oh,

It feels like it&apos;s taken me a million years to rummage through every single article &amp; video to figure out what happened, but we&apos;re here, baby!! This video is going to be focussed on how the tabloids, in my opinion, basically manipulated an entire country (and people in other countries too) to believe a certain narrative for profit, and for the next video in this series I&apos;m going to be analysing the Oprah interview, picking apart the alleged lies they told and the fall-out following, plus more overall analysis of the tabloid industry&apos;s relationship with the Royal Family and its women, and women in general - and the social media conspiracy theories about Meghan&apos;s pregnancies, and Archie and Lilibet being either fake dolls or born by surrogates, plus loads of other CRAY CRAY stuff like that.

In 2024, even though inflation rates have fallen to more manageable levels, prices are still way up and are very unlikely to come down. Which, understandably, continues to be a source of major stress for people all over the world. So why can‚Äôt prices just stay the same?\n\nAs a consumer, steady prices and zero inflation seems like the ideal: You want your purchasing power to stay the same and for your dollar today to buy you exactly the same amount as your dollar tomorrow. But even in times of global economic health and stability, governments and their central banks actively avoid letting inflation get too low. That‚Äôs because 0 percent inflation might actually end up doing more harm than good.\n\nIn this video, we take a look at the reasons why.\n\nSources and further reading:\nTo take a closer look at inflation and interest rates in the US, check out FRED (the Federal Reserve‚Äôs economic data repository): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ \n\nYou can read more about inflation targets here: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/pdf/jahpan-inflation-targeting.pdf  \n\nAnd you can see more of Rakeen‚Äôs work here: https://groundworkcollaborative.org/person/rakeen-mabud/ \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what&apos;s really driving the events in the headlines.

The evening will be a dramatic reading of the Gospel, without commentary.\n\nDavid Suchet is one of the best-known and best-loved actors of his generation. He has worked for the RSC, in the West End and on Broadway, and his most famous role is Hercule Poirot in the long-running television series. In 2011 he was awarded a CBE for services to drama, and in 2014 was given a lifetime achievement award by the Royal Television Society for his performance as Poirot. Raised without religion, he was converted by reading Romans 8 in a hotel Bible.\n\nA practicing Anglican, he has made highly successful BBC documentary series following in the footsteps of St Paul and St Peter, is Vice-President of the Bible Society and his best-selling audio book of the Bible, released in 2014 by Hodder, fulfilled a 27 year ambition.","viewCount":5619317,"lengthSeconds":7339,"watchProgress":1991.726198,"timeWatched":1716085030627,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"rnhE3M1yOw9pwLCg","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Streaming is more expensive than ever, and prices just keep going up. Password sharing has been cracked down on, forcing more of us to pay to stream. And in the backdrop of all that, advertising is back with a vengeance, thanks to the rise of the cheaper ad-supported subscription tiers.\n\nAs a consumer, this feels infuriating. But we‚Äôre not entirely at the whim of these companies. So why is all this happening? And what can we do to not go broke while still enjoying our favorite shows?\n\nNote: The title on this video has been changed.\nPrevious title: Streaming got expensive.

For 23 years it aired every Sunday night and played host to the world&apos;s greatest talents. The Ed Sullivan Show is well known for bringing rock n&apos; roll music to the forefront of American culture through acts like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones.
